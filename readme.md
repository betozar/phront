# PHRONT

Nowadays, there exists a lot of powerful tools and frameworks, sometimes engineers tends to overcomplicate things while trying to deliver the best software quality.

The most important purpose of our jobs is solve people's problems, in my experience as a freelance developer there are many scenarios where my clients need a landing page with a form to register for some social event, a blog to expose their work and a simple payment system.

It's really incredible how local business can make a lot of money (for local scope) using only Facebook, or making videos on TikTok, inclusively some time ago I made a simple administration system for a little travel agency with just a few tables in the database they are using xampp in LAN without any complicated build system, but this system improves the flow of work in that place.

Simplicity, minimalism and client-first approach, these are the reasons why PHRONT is here, CHOOSE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE RIGHT NEED.
